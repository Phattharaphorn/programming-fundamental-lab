# Programming Fundamental Fctivity

Will analyze program specifications and identify appropriate objects and classes. Additional programming topics include graphical user interfaces and UML modeling of small systems, Computer Engineering 60 at KMITL.

  > • When specifying inputs and outputs, work steps can be explained as well. Basic operations (input, output, math and logic expression, condition, loop) that can create output from the specified input
• When defining equations or working conditions, expressions can be written correctly and appropriately.
• when the program behaves incorrectly. There will be a process for checking, finding faults, and being able to fix them to work properly
